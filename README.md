Velociraptor
============

Starter theme for Drupal 7, using SASS and Grunt. By Abby Milberg.

This is intended as a starter theme to be edited directly, not used as a parent theme.

### To Use

* You will need Node, Grunt, and Bundler
* From the root of the project, run "npm install" and "bundle install"
* Run "grunt watch" to run Grunt, and Ctrl+C to stop

### To Do

* Add JS Uglify - https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify

### Random Notes

* I generally use the Drupal jQuery Update module to change public pages to v. 1.7 and leave admin pages alone
* I almost always use the following Modernizr tests: mediaqueries (non-core), touch, rgba, csstransforms (2d), svg, plus printshiv
* I also use these Modernizr tests a lot, but not always: csscalc (non-core), cssanimations, csstransitions
